                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I am Mario Xerri, a first-year Master's student at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate degree at Cornell University with a bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Math.
                    My research interests include LLM Self-Improvement and RL reasoning, as well as machine learning applications for data science and computer vision. I am currently conducting research under Professor Joe Zhou, focusing on compression of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLM agents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most recently, I interned at Evernorth Health (The Cigna Group), where I developed solutions using large language models to extract key information from internal documents. My responsibilities included building the initial solution on company infrastructure, crafting and refining prompts, and assessing model performance within their PBM group. Previously, I interned at UL Solutions as a Data Scientist, developing predictive models for physical flame tests.
                        Additionally, I have worked on ML modeling projects related to human position estimation, object detection, and financial portfolio optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I enjoy running and have participated in varsity athletics throughout college. I am also an avid trumpet player and perform with community bands during the summer. Feel free to reach out to me by email if you have any questions or inquiries.
                </p>
